## User Story
> AS AN employer  
> I WANT a candidate search application  
> SO THAT I can hire the best candidates




## Usage
**The Candidate Search application allows employers to browse candidates fetched from the GitHub API and save the best candidates to a list. Here’s how it works**:

**View Candidate Information**: Upon loading the page, a candidate’s profile will be displayed, including their avatar, name, username, location, email, company, and bio.

**Save Candidates**: When a candidate looks promising, click the "+" button to save them to the list of potential candidates.

**Skip Candidates**: If a candidate is not of interest, click the "-" button to move to the next candidate without saving.

**View Saved Candidates**: On the "Potential Candidates" page, you can see a list of previously saved candidates with their details.

**Persisting Data**: The list of saved candidates is persisted across page reloads, ensuring that the list remains intact when the application is restarted.




## Technologies Used
**React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

**TypeScript**: Superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.

**GitHub API**: RESTful API to access GitHub user data.
